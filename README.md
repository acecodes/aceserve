#AceServe

----
###A simple Node HTTP server.

----

Anybody with Node and <code>npm</code> installed can use this to serve files on their <code>localhost</code>. It's designed to give you a place to rapidly test out static, client-side content within minutes. 

To use it, run the following commands:

    $ npm install
    $ node server
    
The default port for the server is set to 9000 to avoid conflicts with the myriad other programs that use 8080 or 8000.
